    <h2>Bessie Anderson</h2>
    <p>My name is Bessie Anderson and I currently live in a retirement community that has a prohibition on pets.  <br>I really wanted to have a small dog that I could take out for walks, but I though it was not possible.  <br>Then I heard about Rent A Pet and I was excited to give it a try.  I found a  loveable bassett hound and met her when she was delivered to my apartment one Saturday morning.  We went through a long walk in the nearby park and had a wonderful time.  <br>The great Rent A Pet staff came and picked her up two hours later and I didn't even have to worry about feeding or watering "Sophie".  We now have a regular appointment every Saturday, if the weather permits.  I know I look forward to getting in my weekly walk in the park and I imagine Sophie likes it as well.

<br>Thanks for giving me something to look forward to each week,
Yours,
<br>Bessie Anderson</p>

<h2>Jason Hutchingson</h2>
<p>I'm a single college guy and live in an apartment with 3 other guys.  I always wanted to have a large breed of dog that would be a companion to take running or play catch with in the park.  With the help of Rent A Pet, I found Kamaikaze, a German Shephard.  <br>He loves to run in the summer and even cross country ski in the winter.  <br>The best thing Kazi likes to do is play Frisbee and run through an obstacle course.  <br>I always attract the attention of girls in the park when we go there.  <br>I even met my fiance, Janice, when she joined Kazi and me in a heated game of keep away.  <br>One day I will have a home where I can have a yard to keep my own dog.  <br>Until that time, I can still enjoy the companionship of a good dog.  

<br>Thanks to Rent A Pet,
<br>Jason Hutchingson</p>

<h2>Michael Pinette</h2>
<p>My business requires me to travel quite a bit.  So it would be hard for me to own a pet of my own.  <br>I would have to constantly find someone to pet sit, or I would have to pay for boarding the pet.  <br>I also like to surprise and shock my friends with my unusual pets. Rent A Pet is a perfect solution for my lifestyle.  I have rented a snake, a Saint Bernard, a pot belly pig and an iguana.  I know my nurturing skills are sadly lacking because I cannot even keep a house plant alive.  I can have fun with exotic pets without having the worry about keeping them healthy and happy.  <br>Thanks for adding spice to my life.

<h2>Melinda Morrison</h2>
<p>As a young girl, I developed a love of horses.  But I grew up in the city and never had the chance to own my own horse.  I was delighted to find Rent A Pet. <br> They have several horses to choose from for riders of different levels.  <br>They will deliver the horse to the trail where I want to ride.  <br>Because I can request the same horse time after time, I have become very comfortable with my skills and the abilities of the horse I ride.  I would never be able to provide room and board for my own animal.
Thanks for making a dream come true,
Melinda Morrison</p>
